Hello there! I'm **Writedown**.

## Notes

Use a modified block quote syntax to render margin notes or asides:

> Note:
> Look both ways before crossing the street.

## Figures

Writedown will render a figure if a paragraph contains only an image:

## Checkboxes

Convert a paragraph to a checkbox by beginning it with `[ ]`. Checkboxes work inside and outside of lists. Fill a checkbox with an `x` to have it checked when the page is rendered:

[ ] Check this

[ ] Check this too

[x] I am checked

#### To do

- [ ] Get groceries
- [ ] Make the bed
- [ ] Rent a car
